# MOVIE DATABASE

## OBJECTIVE
Read, clean, and consolidate dataset files by method of ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) using Python and SQL. 

## Method
We have decided to examine and combine two CSV files we resourced from Kaggle.com. These CSV files include the “Netflix Movies and TV Shows” dataset and the “Wikipedia Movie Plots” dataset, in which we aim to add in movie descriptions for the current listing of Netflix movies.

## Instructions
1. ### Extract
    1. In Jupyter notebook load, read and define dataframes from netflix movie csv (https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows) and wikipedia movie plot csv (https://www.kaggle.com/jrobischon/wikipedia-movie-plots).

1. ### Transform
    1. ##### Netflix Dataset
        1. Filter the "type" column to only show data that has Movie as the value string and not TV Show as the value.
        1. Filter the dataframe to only show the columns "title", "country", "release_year", and "listed_in"
        1. Change the name of the "listed_in" column to "genre".
        1. Filter the dataframe to only include data where the "release_year" has a value >= 2010 and <=2017.  
    1. ##### Wiki Dataset
        1. Check for missing "Plot" column entries by performing a .dropna.
        1. Filter the dataframe to only include the columnts "Title", "Release Year", "Director", "Genre", "Plot".
        1. Change the names of the columns to "title", "release_year", "director", "genre", and "plot".
        1. Filter the dataframe to only include data where the "release_year" has a value >= 2010 and <=2017.
        1. Perform a drop duplicates for any duplicate movies.
